# ASSIGNMENT
## DAY 13
  -Today is the thirteenth day of my internship,today I learned about how to create a web page using HTML and CSS.I felt so happy that I successfully created one website namely Sarahs Favorite Animal after  a long struggle I complete it.In today morning we had a session,In this session we learned 
about about Eulerian cycle,algorithm etc..,
  -Eulerian cycle is defined as the connected graph contains the eularian cycle if and only if every vertex has even degree of bridge.By using this wedone a task.then we learned about algorithm.
   -Algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations,especially by a computer.for example,if you willing to made a chicken briyani,then ur goal is to make a briyani and you have a specific instructions to make it that instructions are called 
algorithm.
   -then I learned one new thing today that is how to align the position os the text to create a web page in HTML.Usually to align the text we use 
text-align: center;or right;or;left etc this is for align the text.for align the text in paragraph,use Position:absolute;
then it may be right;or left;or center;that was the thing I learned.
   -then I learned about' div'tag.The div tag is used in HTML to make divisions of content in the web page like (text,images,header,footer,navigation bar etc).
   -div tag has both  open<div> tag and close</div> tag.the div tag is mostly used in web development because it is mainly used to divide the section or area to be work,by using this we can create a particular section for particular data or function in the web pages.these are the things I learned 
from web page creata using HTML.
   - then my mentor gave me a three task,(i.e) how to make a chicken briyani using algorithm.I just write down the algorithm for mstking a chicken 
briyani.
   1.Go to market to buy chicken,vegetables and other groceries to prepare chicken briyani.
   2.after return from shop take the bowl and put the chicken,then clean it properly.
   3.take another bowl and put rice,now wash the rice.
   4.take vessel depends upon the rice and chicken quantity.
   5.Now,on the stove and place the vessel in which you have to cook.
   6.then pour oil and then put chopped onions and fry upto it turns into golden color.
   7.then put ginger-garlic paste 2tbsp and fry it for 10-15mins.
   8.then put washed chicken pieces into it,and mesh chicken with it and fry upto 2-3mins in high flame.
   9.then add briyani masala for required quantities.
   10.add a splash of water and fry 2-3 mins on medium flame.
   11.then,add sliced tomato pieces into it and fry it upto tomato become soft.
   12.then add curd init,now mix all the ingredients well.
   13.then add chopped mint into it for fragnance.then cook it for sometimes.
   14.then add chilli for spicy.
   15,then cover the vessel for some minutes,is for settle up all the ingredients.
   16.then add a rice for 2glass of rice add 4 glass of water.
   17.then mix rice and water with ingredients which we prepared into vessel already.
t  18.then again cover the vessel and keep thum upto 30mins.
   19.this thum is for setting rice with ingredients and boil then finally it turns into briyani.
   20.after 30mins now open the vessel now hot and spicy yummy briyani ready.
  this is the algorithm for making chicken briyani.
   -these are the things I learned today in my internship.
