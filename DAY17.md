# ASSIGNMENT
## DAY17
   - Today was the seventeenth day of my internship session,Today I learned about algorithm and flow chart.Programmed algorithm is defined as a procedure or formula used for solving a problem. It is based on conducting a sequence of specified actions in which these actions describe how to do something, and your computer will do it exactly that way every time. An algorithm works by following a procedure, made up of inputs.
  - By using these I tried many algorithm and learned how to create algorithm for some problem which was given by mentor.then I learned about Flow chart is a mind drawing to solve the problem easily.

  - The clear definition of the flow chart is flowchart is a picture of the separate steps of a process in sequential order.It is a generic tool that can be adapted for a wide variety of purposes,and can be used to describe various processes,such as a manufacturing process,an administrative or service process, or a project plan. 
  - Basic Flow Chart Shapes
    The four basic flowchart shapes. Each shape represents a different type of operation.
    - oval: start and end
    - parallelogram: input and output
    - rectangle: calculations
    - diamond: selection structures
  - The basic shapes in a flowchart are connected by arrows. The shapes and arrows in a flowchart represent the flow of a program from start to end.
 - By using flowchart I learned how to obtain solution for problem easily.In Evening we had a session based on the algorithm,then Koushik gave some task (i.e) to solve the problem and written the steps or algorithm,to solve it.

 - then I learned about loop,if,and else in flowchart.
 - loop flow chart refers to a set of instructions that is repeated as long as a criterion holds.The two types of loops are for loops and while loops.
 - For loop repeats statements as long as the last item in the range has not been reached yet.
  - while loop,The idea behind a while loop is to execute statements as long as a condition holds. When the condition becomes false, the statements are no longer executed. To avoid endless loops, you need to update the factors that affect the condition.
  - if and else in flowchart is nothing but if the condition is satisfied then it is a if statement.for example,
   -  adding any two numbers then this number is divisible by 5,now the condition is satisfied.this is if statement in flow chart.
   -  take any two number,now adding that number,then that is not divisible by 5.here conditions are not satisfied,this is else statement.
 - strings;
   -In computer programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable.In formal languages, which are used in mathematical logic and theoretical computer science, a string is a finite sequence of symbols that are chosen from a set called an alphabet.
   - string in javascript:
   - A string is a sequence of one or more characters that may consist of letters, numbers, or symbols. Strings in JavaScript are primitive data types and immutable, which means they are unchanging.
   these are the things that I learned in the today internship.
 thanyou.
