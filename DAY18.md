# ASSIGNMENT
## DAY18
   -Today was the eighteenth day in my internship program.Today I learned about object,string,primitive data types,arrays etc..,
 * Object:
    - Object is used to store keyed collections of elements or more complex entities.object is represented in {}.
    - Example:Car={color:red;Model:TATA;Label:Thanks};
            here Car is an object,Color,Model,Label are key values.
                 red,TATA,Thanks are Properties.
  * Primitive data types:
    -Primitive data types  are nothing but the data type which are immutable,which means it cannot be changed.
     -there are many types of primitive data types are there,some of them are:
       1.String
       2.Boolean
       3.null
       4.Undefined
       5.symbol etc..,
 
    ** Stirng:
       -String is a represents and manipulate a sequence of characters.
    ** Boolean:
       -Boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values:true or False .
    ** Null:
      - The null type has exactly one value
    **Undefined:
      -Undefined represents variable that has not been assigned a value.these are the primitive data types.
  * String;
    - String represents and manipulate a sequenc of characters.strings are useful for holding data that can be represented in text form.some of the most used operations on string are to check their length.
    ex:const str = 'god has all the omnipotent powers.';
       console.log('$(str) $(str.length}');
   answer:32.
  -Then I leaned about string has various prototypes are there some of them are charAt,concat,slice.split,toUppercase,tolowercase etc..,
  - charAt is nothing but to find the index of charAt in given number.take same example which was given above.
   const str = 'god has all the omnipotent powers.');
   const index = 5;
   console.log('The character at index${index} is ${sentence.charAt(index)}'
    - output:The Character at index 5 is a.
    - concat is nothing but concatenation of two sentences are two words which means merging up of two words are sentence.
    ex: const str1 = 'god';
        const str2 = 'omnipotent';
        console.log(str1.concat('',str2);
     -output is god omnipotent.
     -slice is refered as a string extracts a section and create a new without modifying old.
    ex:const str = god has all the omnipotent powers.
       console.log(str.slice(12));
       output is "the omnipotent powers"
     -split is entirely different from slice that is split the word are sentence that was given in the index.
    ex:const str = 'hi hello everyone.';
       const chars = str.split('');
       console.log(chars[4]); result is e.
       const words = str.split('');
       console.log(words[2]); result is hello.
     -toUppercase is nothing but all the lowercase characters in the sentence are changed into uppercase.
     ex: const sentence = 'hi hello everyone.';
         console.log(sentence.toUppercase()); then the ouput is HI HELLO EVERYONE.
     - toLowercase:
       -this is opposite to Uppercase,which means change the uppercase characters in the sentence into lowercase.
     ex: const sentence = 'Hi Hello';
         console.log(sentence.toLowercase()); then the output is 'hi hello'. 
     these are the things I learned today.
   - then I attend the support meeting,and I have a chance to know little bit things about support team.then in the meeting we had a cultural talks which was given by my mentor and based on the meeting my mentor gave a task.then in the evening time I read the next chapter in the book named The journey to the center of the Earth.these are the things that I learned in the today internship.
