# ASSIGNMENT
## DAY 19
    - Today was the nineteenth day of my internship program.In this day I learned many things about strings and their prototype.Today I practised string prototype in console page like string charAT,string concat,string slice,string split,string toUpperCase,string toLowerCase etc..,then I learned new things about flex in html.
    - In html display flex is used to display the div in the required position.the flex property set the flexible length on the flex items,this is the main use of flex,today I have one task (i.e) to adding the more container in div(div is in flex property).actually I already well known about how to use flex.based on this I added the more container in the div,after completing the layout in html I run the code,then only I saw that the width of the container are shrinked and fit it inside the main divison.
    - Then I learned about flex-shrink property,basically by adding the container in the div,the widht of the division are shrinked to obtain the required width we use flex-shrink.by using this I got the seperate div with same width finally.this is the magic of flex-property.
    - Then in the afternoon we had a cultural talks,Actually this is a first cultural talks for us.Askin bro conducted this session.this session was very interesting for me.In this session I learned many things like what is reponsibility,obligation,free will,duty etc...
   - Responsibility is nothing but taking charge by own choice.example:if you are a leader of a team,then you have to take some responsibilty with your own choice by helping to team members to achieving their goal.In case you fail to do it then you have reponsibilities to face the consequences.
   - Obligation is differ from responsibilty (i.e) In responsibility you have taking charge in your own choice but in Obligation not like that here the action which you supposed to do something for someone.Example:If you are borrowing a thing from someone,then you have the obligation to return it.
   - After completing the cultural talks we have a Internship session.In this session I learned about the what is english? What is Language?
   - In this session Koushik show 4 different paragraph and told us to able to read.By showing the first paragraph,the spelling of the words are jumbled but we can able to identified the words and easily read it.then he move to the second paragraph,here spellings are correct but there is no punctuation,no spacing between the words,no sentence terminator but still we find and read the paragraph but compare to first one it is little bit harder.Then he showed the next one in that paragraph we read easily but we can't find the meaning of the paragraph.Which means there is no connectivity between the sentences'and no meaning for the sentence.then finally he showed a last one in this paragraph we cant able to read it.
  - According to this activity Koushik Explained about what is English and language.Language is mainly used for communication.English language is also a commonly used language in the world.Based on this I learned how the English should be,(i.e)English is mainly a communicating language.the better English should have a set of Syntax.the rules are 
     - First word of the sentence should be start with Capital letter.
     - Using puncutations in the correct position.
     - The correct usage of grammar like tenses.
     - At the end of every sentence have a sentence terminator.
     - All the sentence are meaningful.
     - All the words are should be in correct spelling etc..,
  - This are the set of rules (or) syntax for English language.
  - These are the things I learned in the today internship session.
  Thankyou.
