# ASSIGNMENT
## DAY20
  - Today was the twentieth day in my internship.In this day I learned many new things about Arrays.Basicallly Array is nothung but the collection of data stored at contiguous memory location.let we see more things about ARRAYS.

 * ARRAYS:
   - Array in Javascript is an special variable,which can hold more than one values.Ex:const names = ["Pandian","Mani","Sam","Askin"];
   - ARRAY indexes are starting from "0" and use curly braces[] for denoting arrays.

 ** Why We use ARRAYS?
   - If you having a list of items,storing it in single variable.
    let name1 = "Tata";
    let name2 = "Honda";
    let name3 = "BMW";
    - An array can hold 'n'number of values under a single name and we can accesss the value by referring to an index number.
    - In Array,Space and line breaks are not important.
    - By using array I tried many prototype in arrays namely,
     1.How to accessing array elements.
     2.How to changing an Array elements.
     3.How to access the full array.
     4.How to access the first array.
     5.How to use Array.forEach()function etc..,
     6.How to adding an array using push method.
    these are the things I tried.

  ** ASSOCIATIVE ARRAYS:
    - Many Programming language support arrays with named indexes.
    - Array with named indexes are called Associative array (or) Hashes.
    - JavaScript does not support arrays with named indexes.
    - In JS,Arrays are always used in numbered indexes.
    - whereas object are always named indexes.
    - These are the things I learned today about Arrays.
  -Then I completed the task which was given to me by my mentor,The task is to complete the layout and scroll the div seperately using HTML,CSS.   
  - By trying this I learned new things about how ti scroll the div seperately,For scrolling use Overflow.

  ** Overflow:
    -Overflow property in CSS used to controls the content into fit that it is too big.
    - In overflow there are many property like,Overflow-Auto,overflow-hidden,overflow-visible,overflow-scroll,
     -Based on the required axis we use overflow.for example;
     -If you want to scroll the div along x-axis,use Overflow-x:scroll;
     -If you want to scroll the div along y-axis,Use Overflow-y:scroll;
   - Then in the evening we had a task about to create a language by own,according to this we discuss how to create a new language.
   - Then Santhosh Presented his project which is about what are the problem which we facing from library,How to solve it and how to maintain the Library.I learned how to presenting the project and how to prepare the presentation.
   - These are the things happened today and I learned in the today's internship session.
   Thankyou.
