# ASSIGNMENT
## DAY-21
   
     - Today,we are at the first day of the fifth week in the internship program.Today I learned many prototype in arrays,some sort of information about ANGULAR Framework,and learned some knowledege about language formation.Now I am going to tell in brief about all the things I learned today.
   * ARRAYS:
     - Basically array is a collection of data in a single variable.In javascript arrays are not a primitive,In javascript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different datatypes.
     - I tried many prototypes of array namely:Array.prototype.concat,length,find,push,splice,slice,map,forEach,filter,shift,joint,unshift etc..,
    ** Array.prototype.concat: 
        - In concat me merge two arrays and return it into a single array.
        const array1 = ['a','b','c'];
        const array2 = ['d','e','f'];
        console.log(array1.concat(array2));//the output will be
            ["a","b","c","d","e""f"];
    ** Array.prototype.forEach();
      -The forEach() method executes a provided function once for each array of element.
    ** Array.prototpye.slice();
       - The slice method is used to return a copy of a portion of an array into a new array from start to end.where start and end represent index of items af array.The original array will not be changed.
    ** Array.prototype.find();
      - The find method is used to returns the first element in the provided array that satisfied the provided testing function.
    ** Array.prototype.splice:
      - The splice method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing the existing elements or adding new elements in place.
    ** Array.prototype.push()
      - The push method in array is used to add one or more elements in the end of an array.these are the things I learned about arrays.
  * Angular Framework:
    - Framework is a platform for developing software applications.It provides a foundation on which the software developers can build a program for specific platform.there are many frameworks are there namely Flutter,Angular,Node-js,Nest-js etc..,
   ** ANGULAR:
     - Angular Framework is a developoment platform,built on strongly typed programming language based on Javascript.As a platform,Angular includes.
     - A component-based framework for building scalable web applications
     - A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features,including routing,forms management,client-server communication.
     - A suite of developer tools to help you develop,build,test,and update your code with angular.
     - Angular is designed to make updating as straightforward as possible.
  * Command Line Interface:
     - Command Line Interface(CLI) is a text-based User Interface(UI) used to run programs,manage files and interact with computer using terminals.these are the things I learned today.
     - Then in the Evening we had a session about to create a new language,Basically Language is used for communication.Likewise English is a comman communicating language.Today we learned about What is Englisg? and What are the Syntax of English?
     - Then I learned about three major types of analysis in language namely,Syntax anlaysis,Semantical analysis and pragmatic analysis.let see the short notes about the types of analysis.
    * Syntax analysis means the analyse of formation of sentences.
    * Semantical Analysis means the analyse of meaning of the sentence.
    * Pragmatic anlaysis means the analyse of language use in specific suituations.
   - these are the things I learned in the today internship session.
   Thankyou.
