# ASSIGNMENT
## DAY22
   -Today I learned many things about ARRAY prototype like Array.prototype.fill,,Array.prototype.filter,Array.prototype.unshift etc..,
 * Array.Prototype.fill:
    - This fill method is used to changes all elements in an array to a static value.from a start index(default 0) to an end (default array.length).It returns the modified array.
 * Array.prototype.filter:
   - This Filter method used to creata a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
 * Array.prototype.unshift:
   - The Unshif method in array is to add one or more elements to the begining 
of an array and returns the new length of the array.
 * array.prototype.join:
   - The join method creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in an array (or an array-like object),separated by commas or a specified seperator string.if the array has only one item then the item will be reutrned without using the seperator.
  -Then after completing our group gonna discussed with each other about the task of creating a new language.In this discussion I learned some things newly about the language.
  - Then In the Evening we had a small team meeting which was conducted by sherin and she gave an overview about surfpay and support team in surfboard.In that session I learned many things about support team and how it basically functions.  - In this meeting I learned about the many new things about our team,Like MMS,Zendesk,first line support,KYC,tickets etc..,and this meeting is very helpful for me.
  - At last in the evening We had internship session,In this session I learned things about programming language of computer.
  - Basically we have many programming languages like C,C++,JAVA,Python,Javascript etc..,
  - How we have symbols,tokens,expressions,syntax for being a English language as a English.samething there is a token,symbols,expressions,for a computer programming language.
  - Symbols of the programming languages are UNICODE it has 144697 symbols and letter different from 159 scripts.
  - Tokens are Identifier(idn),Operators(op),Puncutators(p),Numerical Literals(nl),String literals(sl) etc..,
  - Expressions are combination of tokens.these tokens are seperated by spaces.
  - keywords - async,const,await,continue,cat etc..,
  - Then we learned about Datatypes.Datatypes give information about the type of data.there are variety of datatypes namely primitive and composite datatypes some of the examples of datatypes are:
  ex:1.String,numbers(or)int,float,double,boolean etc..,these are primitive datatypes.
     2.Arrays,objects,functions are composite datatype.
   ** Array:
     -Basically array is an storage or collection of data stored in a single variable.Syntax of array are.
      1.array starts and ends with square brackets [],
      2.Inside the brackets are elements of the array.
      3.Each Element of the array is seperated by commas(,).
      4.Sentence terminator (or) Punctuator is semicolon(;).
    ex:Arrar1 = [0,1,2,3];
  ** Object: 
     - In object used to store keyedvalue of elements. we have two things one is key and value.Syntax pf object is.
       1.Object start and end with curly braces {}.
       2.Formation of object is by key and value.
       3.Key and value are seperated by (:).
       4.Each Key and value end with(,).
       5.Keys need to unique.
       6.Key can be string,Variable.
      ex: {
            a : "hi",
            b : "hello",
          }
   ** Function;
       - Function are basically Variables.Syntax of function.
       1. Function should start with Function name().
       2.block of the function is start and end with {}.
       3 In Function body or block has literals,operators and sentence terminator,
       4.Finally call back the function name by Function name(); then only the function will run and execute the result.
      ex: 
          add() 
             {
              2+3;
             } 
           add();
       - Overall Today session was very interesting and These are the things I learned from the today's internship session. 
       Thankyou.
