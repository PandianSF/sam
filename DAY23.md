# ASSIGNMENT
## DAY23
   - Today was the twenty third day of internship.Today I learned many things about Different Data types used in Different programming language and some new things about Array in Javascript.
  * Programming languages:
    - Basically language is nothing but to communicate something with someone to understand.Programming language is the same but the communication between Users and computer softwares.There are many programming languages which we used namely c,C++,Java,Javascript,Python,Kotlin,Bitstring etc...
  * Data Types:
    - A data types defines the type of value an object can have and what operations can be performed on it.A datatype should be declared first before being used.Different Programming languages support different data-types.For Example,
    1.C supports char,int,float,long etc..,
    2.Python supports String,list,Tuple etc..,
   - In a broad sense,these are three types of a datatypes:
      1.Fundamental data types
      2.Derived data types
      3.User-defined data types
  * Fundamental data types:
     - These are the predefined data types which are used by the programmer directly to store only one value as per requirement.i.e integer type,character type,or floating type.
  * Derived data types:
     - These data types are derived using built-in data types which are designed by the programmer to store multiple values of same type as per their requirement.example-Array,pointer,function,list etc..,
  * User-defined data types:
      - these data types are derived using built-in datatypes which are wrapped into a single a data type to store multiple values of either same type or different type or both as per the requirement.Example:Class,Structure etc.,
  * Data types supported by C++:   
     -  char,unsigned char,signed char,int,unsigned int,signed int,short int,unsigned short int,signed short int,long int,signed long int,unsigned long int,float,double,long double.
  * Data supported by Java:
     - byte,char,short,int,long,float,double,boolean.
  * Data supported by Erlang:
     - In this language data types are supported by Erlang,which is a functional programming languages.
  -- Number:
       - Erlang supports two types og numerical literals i.e.integer and float.
   *Atom:
    - An atom is a string whose value can't be changed.It must begin with a lowercase letter and can contain any alphanumeric characters and special characters.
when an atom contains special characters,then it should be enclosed inside single quotes(').
   * Boolean:
     - this data type is used to display either true or false.
     - likewise many different data types arte their like Tupel,BitString,list,map etc.,these are the different data types which are used in the different programming languages which we discused in the internship session,and also Koushik taught some kind of basic syntax and simple coding of array,functions,In Function has two steps:Declaration and Execution etc..,
    - Then I learned some new things in array namely array.prototype.pop,array.prototype.indexof().
  * Array.Prototype.Pop:
     - In this method pop removes the last element from an array and returns that element.this method changes the length of the array.
  * The indexOf() method returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array,or -1 if it is not present.these are I learned newly from the array in javascript. 
   - then I learned some information about support team,(i.e)why support team is important? these are the things I learned from the today internship.
    Thankyou.
