# ASSIGNMENT
## DAY-24
   - Today was the twenty-fourth day in my internship,Today I learned some new things about parseInt.My mentor gave me a task that create two input boxes and create "ADD" button,then by giving any value as input and press and button it automatically view the result,this is the probelm given to me.
   - I already well known about creating two input boxes and Button,but I don't know how to add it and view the result with respect to varying the input.I searched in the google,with the help of google I done the task.In google they made the solution they use parseInt but I don't know why parseInt is used then after that Askin bro clarified me about the parseInt now I am clear about it.
   - Now,I explained shortly about parseInt,Basically parseInt is nothing but the parseInt function parses a string argument and returns the integer of the specified base in mathematical numeral system.
   - if the argument is not a string,then it is converted to one using Tosting abstract operation.Leading whitespace in this argument is ignored.
    ex:1.input1 = as22 input2 = 23 for this result will be NaN (Not an Number)
       2.input1 = 22as input2 = 23 for this result will be 45.
   - Here parseInt is taking the first string and parses it into a string.this is the thing I learned today.
    - Then I am preparing my presentation about the Support team,I gathered some information about support team from the google and also Sheehan bro gave me some ideas about how support team works in accenture.I just gone through to the google to complete my presentation.
    - Then in the afternoon We had a Internship session,In this session Koushik bro taught about compiler,and types of analysis through which complete process of the language will be tanslated,and finally he taught about while loop.
  * Compiler:
    - A Compiler is a special program that processes statements written in a particular programming language and turns them into machine language or "code" that a computer processor uses.
    - For any language,It has been some set of principles or constraints to translate it into required language which are,
     1.Lexical Analysis 
     2.Syntatical Analysis
     3.Semantical Analysis
     4.Code generation
   * Lexical Analysis: 
    - Lexical Analysis is first phase of  the compiler also known as scanner.It converts the High level input program into a sequence of Tokens.The Output is a sequence of tokens that is sent to the parser for syntax analysis.
   * Synatical analysis:
    - It is the next phase of the compiler,In which the given input is checked for the confirmation of rules and structure of the formal grammar.wheather input is in the correct syntax of the programming language.
  * Semantical Analysis:
    - It is used to check the input is in correct meaning.
   - These are the main phases which compiler does,after this analysis computer send a input to code generator,This code generator is convert the input into a machine language (i.e) 0 and 1.Finally by using compiler it compiling the machine language into a required user language.these is the working process of compiler.
   - Then Koushik taught about the while loop.Loop is nothing but the repeating the thing upto certain condition.In otherwords the process which end of whch is connected to begining.
   - He solved a problem using while loop condition.I learned about while loop.These are the things I learned in thi today internship session.
   Thankyou.
