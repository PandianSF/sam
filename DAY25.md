# ASSIGNMENT
## DAY-25.
   - In the morning the day starts with session.today we have a whole day session.In morning Koushik taught about the for loop before that he gave a small recall with last day session and he taught about how to us the dart pad.
  * For loop:
   -  When using a for loop, we typically use a counter that will either increment or decrement until a condition is met. Once the condition is met, the loop will stop. 
   Using this for loop,he gave some problems and I found the answer using for loop.
  * DART:
   - DART is nothing but programming language designed for mobile applications.This dart is used in flutter framework.
   - then I learned how to use the dartpad and how to run the code and execute the result.I tried one for loop problem and obtained the solution using dartpad.these are the things I learned from the dart pad.
 - Then in the afternoon session,He taught about class,instance,constructor to us.
  * CLASS:
    - Basically classes are templates for creating objects.They encapsulate dato to work on the data.
    - Class are a "special functions",and it iss similar to functions.It alsi has two components like function has namely,Class expressions and class declarations.
  Example; 
   class.Dog { 
       constructor(name,age,breed)
           { 
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
            this.breed = breed;
           }
         }
           - this is the example for classes.
    * Constructor();
        - The constructor method is a special method for creating and initialising an object created with a class.there can only be a one specail method with the name "constructor" in a class.
     - then I learned about the execution stack,and tried some problems based on the flow and execution stack.for example in the problem we have a certain condition and how we can solve using it easily by using execution stack.this was taught to us.
      - then he taught about  variables in javascript like var,let.and also he gave some overview about scope.
     - then at finally I learned about UI,Basically UI are User Interface,which is a rectangle container or division which seggregate by color,shape,position,content etc..,Usually UI interface or interaction between the user and system with color,content,position.
     -EX:Take Instagram login page all are seperated by different rectangular classes.UI has two components namely smart container and dumb container.noramlly smart container in which we created work or doing somework.but in dumb container it is not having any work it act like a dumb or like a puppet this are the major components about UI.
     - Then he gave a small introduction about FRONT end and Back end.both are same but used in the different framework and different programming languages for front end developers used Angular JS,React Js,Flutter etc.., and for back end developers used python,Javascript,nodeJs,java etc..,.Front end is the part of website that user interacts directly with GUI and it is a client-side of application.Whereas Back end is the server side of the applications,and it is also a part of website that we cannot see and interact with.these are the things I learned from the today internship session.
    Thankyou.
