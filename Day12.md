    -VARIABLES are contains of storing data(storing data values).we use var in always declare javascript variable with var,let,const etc..,
    -var is used in all Javascript code from 1995 to 2015.then 'let','const'were added to J.s in 2015.if you want your code to run in older browser 
you must use var.
