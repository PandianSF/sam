# ASSIGNMENT NO 9
## DAY 9
 * TODAY ACTIVITY
   - 	Today I learned about the booting process of computer.All of you know
that when we power on the computer within a minutes or seconds our windows will be opened,but many of them not aware of the booting process.the process between the power on and user windows having four stages.the stages are:
     - BIOS
     - Boot Loader
     - Kernel
     - Init
  -BIOS :
    BIOS is Basic Input and Output System is used to initialises the hardware 
and make sure it on POST.POST is an acronym of (Power On Self Test) is used to 
check all hardwares if it is ok to load boot in process.
   - Boot Loader:
       It is used to loads the Kernel into memory and start the kernel with a set of parameters.one of the most common boot loader is GRUB.this process of boot is called MBR (Master Boot Record).
    - Kernel:
       When kernel is loaded it initialises device and memory.The main job of kernel is load up the init process.
    - Init:
       Init is a first process gets started.init starts and stop the essential process on system.these are the major process in booting the computer.
   - Then I learned about figma,Figma is a pictorial graphics editor and prototyping tool which is primarily web-based,with additional offline features enabled by desktop applications for macOS and Windows.
   - then I tried to develop my app by using figma.
   - then in the evening we had a seesion about Cyber security.Cyber security.Cyber security will help you to develop expertise in defensive security,application security and malware analysis.then we learned hackers and types of hackers skills required to be in cyber security and finally we learned
main essential things in cyber security.these are I learned in the today internship.
