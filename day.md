# ASSIGNMENT
## DAY15
    - Today was the fifteenth day of my internship.today I learned new things about how to design the layout using HTML and CSS.today I done a task,to create
a layout  using HTML.then I read a next one chapter in book reading.then I learnabout flex in html.after setting a style of container you have to do the magic using flex.
    -Flex:The flex property is a shorthand property for:

    flex-grow
    flex-shrink
    flex-basis

The flex property sets the flexible length on flexible items.
     -then next I learned about Flex-direction by using this we have to chang ethe direction of flex wheather it is in column,or vertical or row.the basic definition of flex-direction:The flex-direction property specifies the direction of  the flexible items.these are the things I learned in design layout using HTML,and CSS.
    ALGORITHM:
      -Algorithm for do addition,subtraction,multiplication and division using calculator:for ex(take two numbers 3 and 5)
       1.Take a calculator first.
       2.then 'on' the calculator using'on' button.
          now I tell for addition.
       3.then press"3" now the number will displayed.
       4.then press"+" for adding.
       5.then press"5".
       6.after pressing "5" and finally enter"=" symbol in the calculator.
       7.now we got the answer.
       8.instead of "+" symbol, press"-"symbol for subtraction in calculator.
       9.then for same thing instead of"+" symbol,press"*"symbol for multiplication and press"/"for division.
      -this is the algorithm for doing addition,subtraction,multiplication,and division using calculator.
  -these are the things I learned today.
  thankyou.
