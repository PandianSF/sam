# DAILY ASSIGNMENT
## DAY 12
  - Today was thirteenth day of internship, today I learned about HTML,CSS let I explain it in brief.
  * HTML
    - HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language is used to create a web pages.It describe the structure of a web page.
    - HTML consists of a series of elements and HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content and label pieces of content such as "this is a heading","this is a link",etc..,
  * HTML element:
    -  It is defined by a start tag,some content and an end tag:
    <tag name>content</tag name>.some html elements are;
    <h1>My first heading</h1>
    <p1>My first paragraph</p1>
   - all HTML document must start with a document type declaration:<!DOCTYPE html>
   - the HTML document itself begin with <html> and ends with </html>
   - the visible part of HTML is inbetween the <body> and </body>
   - <h1> is for title </h1>
   -<p1>between paragraph</p1>
   -to inser images:use<img src="image.jpg" alt="image name"width height
   - src for source file and alt is for alternative text.
    then I tried some HTML document to create a web page using HTML.

   * CSS
    - CSS stands for CASCADING STYLE SHEETS is used to format the layout of webpage.
    - With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out,
 what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!
   - CSS can be added to the HTML document  in three ways;
    1. inline CSS
    2.internal CSS
    3.External CSS
  then we had a session in the evening,On that session I learned proportional logic,Proportional logic means the condition is neither true nor false.
based on this proportional logic three types of proportionals are there namely;
    1.Conjunction (^)
    2.Negotiation (~)
    3.disjunctionb(v)
then we learned about logical implication,biconditional statements and based on this I learned truth tables.then I read the next two chapters in  book named "journey to the center of the earth" and I learned the meaning of some new words which are not familiar to me.
  these things are I learned in the today's Internship.
