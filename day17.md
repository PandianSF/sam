# ASSIGNMENT
## DAY16
   -Today was the first day of fourth week in my internship.I learned about overflow-Property in HTML.The overflow property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.
The overflow property has the following values:

    visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element box.
    hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible.
    scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content.
    auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary.
   - then I tried to design the web page for my own application using html,css.then in the evening we had a session about algorithm.but today we have a physical activity that assume a robot is here,how will you instruct to the robot that robot will move to dart area and take the dart,then throw the dart in center and return back to its position.for this we create a algorithm and guide it successfully.today the session was quite interesting and full of fun.
  -algorithm for how to make a text message using mobile? 
     -take the mobile phone first.
     -then switch on the mobile,now display will open.
     -then,slide the display find out the message application.(In some mobile message application is in home screen)
     -now tap or press the message application,to open the application.
     -In message application we have two section,one is "to" bar and other is "text" bar.
     -now press the "text" bar,here we have to text the message that what is going to be typed in text.
     -after finishing texting move to the "to" bar.
     -now tap"to" bar,here we have to type the mobile number to whom you have to send the text.
     -finally press send button.now the message sent.
           this is the algorithm to make a text message using mobile.
    -then I learned about float property in css.flow property.The float property is used for positioning and formatting content. 
        e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.
    -The float property can have one of the following values:

    left - The element floats to the left of its container
    right - The element floats to the right of its container
    none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
    inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
    - In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.
    - then I also learned about clear property.The clear property specifies what should happen with the element that is next to a floating element.
    - The clear property can have one of the following values:

    none - The element is not pushed below left or right floated elements. This is default
    left - The element is pushed below left floated elements
    right - The element is pushed below right floated elements
    both - The element is pushed below both left and right floated elements
    inherit - The element inherits the clear value from its parent.these are the things I learned in today internship.
    thankyou.
